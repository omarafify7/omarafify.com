# SnoutNet: Pet Nose Localization

## Overview

SnoutNet is a computer vision system designed to detect and localize pet noses in images with high precision. The system addresses the unique challenge of pet nose patterns, which are as distinctive as human fingerprints, enabling applications in pet identification, lost pet recovery, and automated health monitoring through nose pattern analysis.

## Problem

Pet identification traditionally relies on microchips or tags, which can be lost or damaged. Nose prints offer a natural biometric identifier, but manual comparison is time-consuming and error-prone. Automated nose localization and pattern extraction requires handling diverse breeds, lighting conditions, and image qualities.

## Solution

The system uses a combination of object detection and keypoint localization to identify pet noses in images, then extracts and encodes nose patterns for comparison. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of pet images across multiple species and breeds to ensure robustness.

## Architecture

- YOLO-based object detection for initial nose region identification
- Keypoint detection network for precise nose boundary localization
- Pattern extraction pipeline that normalizes and encodes nose textures
- Similarity matching system for comparing nose patterns across images
- Data augmentation strategies to handle lighting, angle, and breed variations

## Implementation Details

- Custom dataset collection and annotation pipeline for pet nose images
- Transfer learning from pre-trained object detection models
- Multi-task learning combining detection and keypoint regression
- Robust preprocessing pipeline handling various image formats and qualities
- Evaluation metrics for both localization accuracy and pattern matching performance

## What I Learned

- Pet nose patterns present unique challenges compared to human biometrics
- Data diversity is critical for handling breed-specific variations
- Keypoint localization requires careful annotation and loss function design
- Real-world deployment needs to handle edge cases (occlusions, poor lighting)
- Pattern matching accuracy depends heavily on normalization techniques

## Future Improvements

- Support for video input and temporal tracking
- Integration with mobile applications for real-time identification
- Expansion to additional pet biometric features (ear patterns, paw prints)
- Database system for storing and querying nose pattern encodings
- Active learning strategies for improving model performance with user feedback
